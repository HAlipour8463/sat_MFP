Max-Flow algorithms with different types of initialisations

This repository contains push-relabel algorithms (sat_hipr, sat_par, satp2r) and pseudo flow algorithms (sat_hipf), representing updated versions of hipr, par, p2r, and hipf tailored to function with both simple and non-simple initializations. Further information on various types of initializations can be found in the paper referenced below:
