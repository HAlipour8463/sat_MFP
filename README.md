# sat_MFP
MFP algorithms with different types of initialisations

This repository includes the push-relabel algoritms (sat_hipr, sat_par, satp2r) and pseduo flow algorithms (sat_hipf), which are the new veriosn of hipr, par, p2r, and hipf adapted to work with simple and non-simple initialsiations. More details about different types of initialisations can be found in the below papr:

The origianl source codes are taken from Andrew Goldberg and Dorit Hochbaum.
