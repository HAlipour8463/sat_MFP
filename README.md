# sat_MFP
MFP algorithms with different types of initialisations

Teh repository includes the push-relabel algoritms (sat_hipr, sat_par, satp2r) and pseduo flow algorithms (sat_hipf) enabled to work with simple and non-simple initialsiations. More details about different tyoes of initialisations can be found in the below papr:
